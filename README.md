This is a simple calculator I made to calculate dividends
It asks for the current share price ($), current dividend yield (%), and the number of shares you own.
It then calculates the rough dividends you get per year ($)
It then asks if you want to reinvest the dividends
  if so, it will ask how many years you want to calculate for
  then it will print out each year and show:
    - The current shares you have
    - How much they are worth
    - Expected dividend payments p.a.

  if not, it will ask how many years you want to calculate for
  then it will print out:
    - The current shares you have
    - How much they are worth
    - Total estimated dividend payments from all of those years combined
